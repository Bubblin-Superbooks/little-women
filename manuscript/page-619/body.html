What do you want for lunch? Cake, sandwiches, fruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I suppose?"</p><p>"Oh, dear, no! We must have cold tongue and chicken, French chocolate and ice cream, besides. The girls are used to such things, and I want my lunch to be proper and elegant, though I do work for my living."</p><p>"How many young ladies are there?" asked her mother, beginning to look sober.</p><p>"Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won't all come."</p></div> </div>
