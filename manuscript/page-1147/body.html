<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">shames,The record of a maiden heartNow learning fairer, truer spells,Hearing, like a blithe refrain,The silver sound of bridal bellsIn the falling summer rain.</p><p>Four little chests all in a row,Dim with dust, and worn by time,Four women, taught by weal and woeTo love and labor in their prime.Four sisters, parted for an hour,None lost, one only gone before,Made by love's immortal power,Nearest and dearest evermore.Oh, when these hidden stores of oursLie open to the Father's sight,May they be rich in golden hours,Deeds that show fairer for the light,Lives whose brave music long shall ring,Like a spirit-stirring strain,Souls that shall gladly soar and singIn the long sunshine after rain.</p><p>"It's very bad poetry, but I felt it when I wrote it, one day when I was very lonely, and had a good cry on a rag bag. I never thought it would go where it could tell tales," said Jo, tearing up the verses the Professor had treasured so long.</p></div> </div>
