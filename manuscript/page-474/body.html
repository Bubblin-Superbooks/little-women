Also my $100, to do what he likes with.</p><p>To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with pockets—also my likeness, and my medal, with much love.</p><p>To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get it), also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of her 'little girl'.</p></div> </div>
