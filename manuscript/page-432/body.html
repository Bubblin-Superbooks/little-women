You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take you out every day, driving or walking, and we'll have capital times. Won't that be better than moping here?"</p><p>"I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way," began Amy, in an injured voice.</p><p>"Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well.
