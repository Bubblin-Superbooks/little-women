<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">wailing baby, and a group of pale, hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.</p><p>How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in.</p><p>"Ach, mein Gott! It is good angels come to us!" said the poor woman, crying for joy.</p><p>"Funny angels in hoods and mittens," said Jo, and set them to laughing.</p><p>In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak. Mrs. March gave the mother tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own. The girls meantime spread the table, set the children round the fire, and fed them like so many hungry birds, laughing, talking, and trying to understand the funny broken English.</p></div> </div>
