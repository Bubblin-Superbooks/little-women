Is he ill?"</p><p>"La, no Miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of his tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman, so I dursn't go nigh him."</p><p>"Where is Laurie?"</p><p>"Shut up in his room, and he won't answer, though I've been a-tapping. I don't know what's to become of the dinner, for it's ready, and there's no one to eat it."</p><p>"I'll go and see what the matter is. I'm not afraid of either of them."</p><p>Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie's little study.</p><p>"Stop that, or I'll open the door and make you!" called out the young gentleman in a threatening tone.</p></div> </div>
