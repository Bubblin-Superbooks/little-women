I shall row and tramp about, so I don't want any starch to think of. You'll come, Betty?"</p><p>"If you won't let any boys talk to me."</p><p>"Not a boy!"</p><p>"I like to please Laurie, and I'm not afraid of Mr. Brooke, he is so kind. But I don't want to play, or sing, or say anything. I'll work hard and not trouble anyone, and you'll take care of me, Jo, so I'll go."</p><p>"That's my good girl. You do try to fight off your shyness, and I love you for it. Fighting faults isn't easy, as I know, and a cheery word kind of gives a lift. Thank you, Mother," And Jo gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March than if it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth.</p><p>"I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy," said Amy, showing her mail.</p></div> </div>
