<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.</p><p>Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even in that big house full of strangers. She gave me a funny little sky parlorâ€”all she had, but there is a stove in it, and a nice table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I like. A fine view and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs, and I took a fancy to my den on the spot. The nursery, where I am to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next Mrs. Kirke's private parlor, and the two little girls are pretty children, rather spoiled, I fancy, but they took to me after telling them The Seven Bad Pigs, and I've no doubt I shall make a model governess.</p><p>I am to have my meals with the children, if I prefer it to the great table, and for the present I do, for I am bashful, though no one will believe it.</p></div> </div>
